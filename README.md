# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## Start the application

- Clone this repository to your local folder.
- Open index.html in your browser.
- The tests were written in the feedreader.js file.
- Test results show up in the bottom of the webpage.
- Green means pass, and red means failed.

## Tests

1. RSS Feeds
	- Make sure the allFeeds is defined and is not empty.
	- URL is defined and not empty in each feed in allFeeds.
	- name is defined and not empty in each feed in allFeeds.
2. The menu
	- The menu is hidden by default.
	- The visibility of the menu is toggled on and off by clicking.
3. Initial Entries
	- At least one entry in the feed.
	- The content changed when the new feed is loaded.
